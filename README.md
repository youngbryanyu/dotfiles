# My dot files
My dot files. I am currently running on a 2022 M2 MacBook Pro (ARM).

## Setup
Simply run the following: 
```
git clone https://github.com/youngbryanyu/dotfiles.git
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
This will clone the dot files and create symlinks from the home dir to the dot files in the cloned repo dir.
